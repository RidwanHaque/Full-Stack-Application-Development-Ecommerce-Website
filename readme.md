## Technology Stack Recommendations### Frontend Development FrameworkBased on comprehensive analysis of current industry trends and internship requirements, **React.js with TypeScript** emerges as the optimal frontend choice [9][10][11]. React maintains the highest industry demand among frontend frameworks, with over 1.8 million weekly downloads compared to alternatives, making it essential for competitive internship applications [12][13]. TypeScript integration adds enterprise-level type safety and demonstrates advanced JavaScript proficiency valued by top-tier technology companies [14][15].

### 3D Viewer Implementation**Three.js** represents the superior choice for 3D asset visualization over alternatives like Babylon.js or Sketchfab API [16][17]. Three.js offers the optimal balance of learning curve accessibility, extensive documentation, and industry adoption for web-based 3D graphics [18]. The library's WebGL foundation provides GPU-accelerated rendering capabilities essential for smooth 3D asset preview across desktop and mobile devices [19][20]. Major platforms like Sketchfab utilize Three.js technology for their interactive 3D viewers, validating its production-readiness for e-commerce applications [21].

### Backend ArchitectureThe **Node.js with Express.js** combination provides full-stack JavaScript development, enabling seamless knowledge transfer between frontend and backend components [22][23][24]. This technology stack supports the high-performance REST API requirements for 3D asset management while maintaining excellent ecosystem compatibility with modern development tools [25][26]. Express.js offers robust middleware support essential for authentication, file handling, and API security implementation [27].

### Database and Cloud Infrastructure**PostgreSQL on AWS RDS** delivers the ACID compliance necessary for financial transaction processing while providing managed database services that reduce operational complexity [28][29][30]. AWS infrastructure offers comprehensive cloud services including EC2 for application hosting, S3 for 3D asset storage, and CloudFront for global content delivery [31][32][33]. This combination demonstrates cloud architecture expertise highly valued in enterprise environments [34].## System Architecture OverviewThe platform employs a layered architecture approach optimized for scalability and maintainability across multiple technology domains [35][36]. The frontend layer implements React.js components with Three.js integration for 3D visualization, while maintaining responsive design principles for cross-device compatibility [37][38]. The API gateway layer handles request routing and authentication middleware, ensuring secure communication between client and server components [39].

Backend services utilize a microservice-ready architecture supporting user management, asset processing, payment handling, and AI chatbot functionality [40][41]. Database layers separate transactional data storage in PostgreSQL from file storage in AWS S3, optimizing performance and cost-effectiveness [42][43]. External service integrations include Stripe for payment processing, OpenAI for intelligent customer support, and AWS services for infrastructure management [44][45].## Development Timeline and Project PhasesThe 39-week development timeline strategically distributes work across seven distinct phases, ensuring comprehensive skill development while maintaining realistic delivery expectations [46][47]. Initial phases focus on project setup, team coordination, and foundational architecture decisions crucial for long-term success [48]. Backend development spans 9 weeks, covering database design, REST API implementation, user authentication, and file upload systems for 3D asset management [49][50].

Frontend development parallels backend efforts with React component architecture, responsive UI design, and product catalog functionality [51]. The 3D integration phase dedicates specific time to Three.js implementation, asset preview systems, and Blender script management [52]. Final phases address payment security, AI integration, comprehensive testing, and AWS deployment configuration [53][54].## Team Roles and Skill Development### Full-Stack Lead (Project Coordinator)The full-stack lead coordinates overall project architecture, manages code reviews, and ensures successful system integration across all technology components [55].
